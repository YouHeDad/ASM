                              Song Player                         V1.0 28/10/97

  Here is a small song player on the TI-83 (the first I think). This works with
an earphone plugged in the link-port (a piezzo buzzer, etc), or with an AM ra-
dio...

To make it work:
---------------

  Send group SONGPLAY.83g and one or more song(s) (SNDXFILE.83p) to your calc
  Run program SONGPLAY
  Enter the name of the song (SNDXFILE)
  And enjoy =)

You can exit at any time by pressing [Clear].

  Note : Don't try to plug a 3.5mm jack into your link-port ! I'm not 
responsible of what could happen to your calc !

  I use a small piezo buzzer (without internal oscillator), with a half link 
cable : connect one pin of the piezo to the ground ( the cooper wire ), and the
other to the data wire ( the white or the red, it doesn't matter )


Features:
--------

 * Multi-song abalities (just give the name of the song).
 * Few memory wasted (the songs are squished. You can squish the program
  ZSNGPLAY : I haven't squished the program, bacause it's smaller than the size
  taken by ZASMLOAD and the squished program).


How to make your songs:
----------------------
  I've planned to write a tool that could make a song ready to send, but it
isn't finished yet... But you can make your song using the NOTES.TXT table, and
writing a program for TASM like this:

  .word What_to_load_in_HL, What_to_load_in_DE

Note: don't forget to put a word 0,0 at the end of your program, or your calc
      should freeze...

and then assemble and make a TI-83 prog from this... Then you'll have to squish
it, and you will be able to listen to your creation =)
