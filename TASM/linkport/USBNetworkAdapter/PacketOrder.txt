host -> device 
    -host issues SOF (start of frame) sequence (a continuous poll with an incrementing value for syncing)
    -device powers on and pulls up D- or D+
    -host sends a reset sequence to device
    -device resets, then enters the 'default state' where it can now
        Default State = After reset but before receiving Set Address.
        In the Default state, the only valid requests are Get Descriptor, and Set Address. 
            "The hub performs the required reset processing for that port (see Section 11.5.1.5). When the reset
            signal is released, the port has been enabled. "
