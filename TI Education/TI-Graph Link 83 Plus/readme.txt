General Information about Flash Software

Flash software is a general term referring to any software that can be 
installed on a Flash-capable TI graphing calculator. Flash software can 
be Free or For Purchase.

Flash software can be downloaded from the web, from the TI Resource 
CD, or transmitted between calculators. Flash software can be upgraded, 
removed, and stored on a computer. 

Flash software includes:

o Operating System (OS) - A TI Flash-capable calculator cannot operate 
properly without the OS. The OS may be upgraded by downloading the 
current version.

o Calculator Software Application - Supplementary software that can be 
installed and run on a TI Flash-capable graphing calculator. Applications 
may be downloaded, upgraded, and deleted.

o Certificate - "Permission slip" for purchasing Flash software on the web, 
CD, and diskettes. 

Free and For Purchase Flash Software

Free Flash Software - You do not need to obtain a certificate for your 
calculator before installing free Flash software, such as language 
localization applications. To obtain free Flash software, you only need to 
copy the software to your computer from the web, a CD, or diskette, or it 
can be transmitted between calculators.

For Purchase - If the Flash software is for purchase, you need to obtain 
and install a certificate for your calculator before you can install the 
application. You can register your calculator and obtain a certificate from 
the web, a CD, or diskette. Copy the certificate and application to your 
computer and then install them on your calculator.

For More Information

Detailed procedures about sending and receiving Flash software, and 
upgrading the operating system using TI-GRAPH LINK are described 
in the TI-GRAPH LINK guidebook on the TI Resource CD. 

Flash Software Installation Instructions

You must use TI-GRAPH LINK software and the TI-GRAPH LINK cable 
to install Flash software on your calculator.

If you need the TI-GRAPH LINK software or a cable, go to the TI 
website: http://www.ti.com/calc/docs/link.htm 

Caution: Do not attempt to install an application if a low-battery 
message appears on your calculator.

Installing an Application Using Windows

1. Connect a TI-GRAPH LINK cable between the Windows computer and 
the calculator.

Note: If you have the gray TI-GRAPH LINK cable, you may need to use 
the 25-pin to 9-pin adapter to connect to the computer. (The black cable, 
which works with Windows 95 or higher, has a built-in 9-pin connector.)

2. If the calculator is on, make sure it is on the home screen.

3. Start the TI-GRAPH LINK software program.

4. From theTI-GRAPH LINK menu bar, choose Link > Send Flash 
Software > Applications and Certificates... The Send Flash Software 
window displays.

5. Click the appropriate folders in the Directories field (and the Drives field, 
if necessary) to find and select the folder where the application was 
downloaded. The application(s) you can install are displayed in the File 
Name list.

6. Click the application name in the File Name field.

7. Click Add to copy the file name into the File Selected field.

8. Click OK. The Sending window displays the progress as the file(s) are 
sent to your calculator. The TI-GRAPH LINK window displays when the 
installation is complete.

9. Click OK to return to the TI-GRAPH LINK main screen.

Installing an Application Using a Macintosh

1. Connect a TI-GRAPH LINK cable between the Macintosh computer and 
your calculator.

Note: If you have the gray TI-GRAPH LINK cable, you may need to use 
a USB to serial port adapter to connect to the computer.

2. If the calculator is on, make sure it is on the home screen.

3. Start the TI-GRAPH LINK 2 for Macintosh software program (version 2.2 
or higher) and establish a connection to your calculator.

4. Choose Connection from the menu bar.

5. Click your calculator type in the list displayed.

6. Click Connect. The calculator window is displayed.

7. Drag the application file that you downloaded onto the calculator window. 
The Sending window displays the progress as the file(s) are sent to your 
calculator. The updated calculator window displays when the installation 
is complete.

Localizing Your TI-83 Plus or TI-83 Plus Silver Edition

You can localize the TI-83 Plus or TI-83 Plus Silver Edition so that it will 
display menus, prompts, functions, and error messages in a language 
other than English. 

Note: If you choose to reset All RAM or Arc Vars, the language is 
unaffected. If you reset Apps or All Memory, the language application is 
deleted and the language reverts to English.

Localization Cross-Reference Table

Once localized, you can cross-reference the display items (strings) using 
the PDF files on the TI Resource CD. Use the Browse option in Utilities 
and go to Flash\83p\OS to access the localization cross-reference 
table.

The cross-reference tables are named pfigs.pdf and scand_nl.pdf. The 
pfigs.pdf file contains a table with English, Portuguese, French, Italian, 
German, and Spanish. Scand_nl.pdf contains a table with English, 
Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, and Dutch.

You must have Adobe Acrobat Reader to view PDF files.

Follow the Flash Software Installation Instructions above.

The localization files are on the TI Resource CD in the directory that 
contains the TI-83 Plus / TI-83 Plus Silver Edition operating system files. 
The path is Flash\83p\OS\(language). Click on the desired 
language folder and choose a localization file.
